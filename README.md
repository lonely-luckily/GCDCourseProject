# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

The R script, `run_analysis.R` is designed to prepare clear and tidy dataset 
from data of collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Before using this script you should download the archive of the data and unpack it 
into your working directory. Please, do not rename files or folders - this version of  
script uses original names of files.

The code was designed to instantly interact with the user, so for passing 
every step of project (tasks), user should confirm the further execution.
That's why every part of code is covered in function.

For correct using of this script you should have 'dplyr' package
installed.

To begin, load script and call "run_analysis" function without any arguments

The end result is shown in the file "UCI_HAR_Averages.txt.txt".
